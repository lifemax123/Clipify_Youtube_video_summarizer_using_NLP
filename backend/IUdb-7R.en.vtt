Hey guys. In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to open a new activity when clicking a button

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.220
For this, we start a new Android Studio project

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.540
We keep the name as it is and click "Next"

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.450
We keep the "Minimum SDK" as well

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.050
And we choose "Empty Activity"

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.370
Here we keep the name as well and click "Finish"

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.760
Now of course, we need a second activity. So we right-click on our package

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.300
New-&gt;Activity-&gt;Empty Activity

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.840
We call the name "Activity2"

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.700
And click "Finish"

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.480
Now, let's prepare the layout for our MainActivity

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560
We change this ConstraintLayout to a RelativeLayout

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.720
And let's change this TextView to "Activity 1"

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.140
We can also delete these constrains here

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.880
And we put this text in the middle

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.300
Let's copy this layout for our second activity

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.260
Go to Activity2

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.340
Paste it here

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320
And we change the text to "Activity 2"

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.730
So we always see which activity we are in currently

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.600
Back to our MainActivity

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.010
Because now of course, we also have to add a button

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.500
Which brings us to our Activity2

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.680
So we add a Button. wrap_content width and height

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.600
We set the text to:

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.810
"open activity 2"

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.820
And it also needs an ID. So we write id

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.760
+id

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.160
And we set the ID to simply "button"

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.580
And let's put this button under this TextView here

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.090
Okay, nice. Back to our MainActivity.java file

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.650
First, we need to prepare a variable for our button. So we write:

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.980
private Button button;

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.260
And down here in our onCreate() method we are going to initialize this button

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.770
We say: button = findViewById(R.id.button)

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.620
Which is our XML id for this button

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.020
Semicolon.. and of course we also have to cast it to a Button here

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.760
Nice.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.100
Next we set an onClickListener() for this button

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.700
We write button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener())

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.700
And in this OnClick() method we are going to call

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.330
openActivity2();

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.680
And we create this method down here

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.560
We write: public void openActivity2()

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.120
And in here we are going to open our second activity

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.800
And this is very simple process. We simply create an Intent with

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.380
Intent intent = new Intent()

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.870
We pass the context, which is "this"

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.240
And we pass the class we want to open

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.400
Which is Activity2.class

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.580
And in the next line we write:

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.300
startActivity() and we pass the intent we just created

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560
And that's basically the whole process

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.160
This part here will open the second activity. Let's test it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.880
Okay, as you can see here we are in Activity 1 currently

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.660
Now we click our button

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.780
And we changed to Activity2

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.080
When we click the back button, we get back to Activity 1

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.400
And if you click again, we go back to Activity 2

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.500
I hope this was helpful. Take care
